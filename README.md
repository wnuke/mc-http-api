Get access to the repo by asking wnuke (wnuke#1010 on Discord). Download the source code:

 - `git clone git@github.com:wnuke-dev/mc-http-api`

If you do not have an IDE you should download one, I recommend [IntelliJ IDEA CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

Import the project to your IDE of choice:

 - `cd mc-http-api`
 - `./gradlew genSources`
 - `./gradlew openIdea` for IntelliJ IDEA
 - `./gradlew eclipse` for Eclipse
